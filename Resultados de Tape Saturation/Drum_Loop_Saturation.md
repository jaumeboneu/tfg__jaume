# Analysis of Saturation on Drum Loop

This example shows the effect of **tape saturation** applied to a drum loop. The developed plugin was used to demonstrate how saturation affects the harmonic content, dynamics, and timbre of the audio.

Two tests were performed.

## 1. Saturation without Volume Compensation

In this first case, saturation was increased without applying any adjustment to the output volume.

## 2. Saturation with Volume Compensation

Here the same saturation process is repeated, but the output volume is adjusted using the plugin’s output gain parameter to match the perceived level of the original signal.
