# Example of Effects: Tape Saturation

This example demonstrates the characteristic effect of **analog tape saturation** using the **UADx Oxide Tape Recorder** plugin. Only one parameter was modified: a gradual increase of the Input Gain, while keeping all other controls at their default values.

The goal is to observe how the sound behaves under saturation, both from an auditory perspective and visually through a spectrum analyzer.
