# Example of Effects: Filters

This example shows how three common types of filters behave in digital audio signal processing. Screenshots of the settings and demonstration videos have been included to illustrate the sonic effect of each one.

## 1. Peak Filter – Head Bump

**Settings:**
- Center frequency: 80 Hz
- Gain: +3.5 dB
- Quality factor ($Q$): 0.70

This filter emulates the low-frequency boost that occurs in analog tape recorders, a phenomenon known as *head bump*.

## 2. High-Pass Filter

**Settings:**
- Type: Butterworth
- Cutoff frequency: 20 Hz
- Quality factor ($Q$): 0.71 (default value in Ableton)

This filter removes unwanted sub-bass frequencies below 20 Hz. The difference is barely noticeable by ear, since these frequencies are below the threshold of human hearing. However, it does make a difference in the final mix after mastering.

## 3. Low-Pass Filter

**Settings:**
- Type: Butterworth
- Cutoff frequency: 5 kHz
- Quality factor ($Q$): 0.71 (default value in Ableton)

This filter softens or removes high frequencies.
