# Example of Effects: Wow Effect (Pitch Modulation)

This example shows the behavior of the **wow effect**, a slow, periodic pitch modulation typical of analog tape systems with mechanical variations in playback speed.

For this demonstration, the preset **"Vibrato Spacial"** in Ableton Live was used, which emulates this behavior using an LFO applied to pitch.

## 1. Modified Parameters
- **Amount**: LFO depth (how much the pitch varies)
- **Rate**: LFO speed (oscillation frequency)

As the **amount** is increased, the modulation becomes more pronounced. The rate parameter controls whether the effect is slower and subtle, or faster and more noticeable.
