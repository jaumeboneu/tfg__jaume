# Analysis of Saturation on Pure Signals

This example shows the effect of **tape saturation** applied to pure signals. The developed plugin was used to observe how saturation introduces harmonics and modifies dynamic behavior.

Two tests were performed.

## 1. Saturation Applied to a Simple Sine Wave

In this first case, saturation is applied to a pure sine wave.

## 2. Saturation Applied to a Chord

In this second test, the same saturation effect is applied, but on a chord.
